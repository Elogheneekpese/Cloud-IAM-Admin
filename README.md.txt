# Cloud IAM Hands-on Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio demonstrating my practical, hands-on experience in implementing and managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) across leading cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

## Overview

This collection of documentation showcases my real-time engagement with core cloud computing skills focused on the critical areas of user, group, and policy management. I illustrate my ability to administer and secure cloud environments effectively through step-by-step guides, practical examples, and detailed notes. The goal of this repository is to provide tangible evidence of my proficiency in IAM principles and their application in diverse cloud ecosystems.

## Portfolio Contents

This portfolio is organized to demonstrate my skills across different cloud providers:

* **AWS Expertise:** Practical documentation covering AWS IAM (Users, Groups, Roles, Policies), AWS Organizations, and related security services. This highlights my ability to manage access control and organizational structures within the AWS environment.
* **GCP Proficiency:** Hands-on examples and documentation focusing on Google Cloud IAM (Principals, Groups, Roles, Policies), Resource Manager, and relevant security features. This demonstrates my capability to implement and manage IAM within the GCP ecosystem.
* **Azure Skills:** Detailed documentation showcasing my experience with Azure Active Directory (Users, Groups), Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Management Groups, and associated services. This illustrates my proficiency in managing identity and access in the Microsoft Azure cloud.

Within each cloud provider's section, you will find concrete examples of tasks such as:

* Provisioning and managing individual user accounts.
* Structuring users into groups for streamlined administration and permission management.
* Defining and implementing various policy types to enforce security and access controls.
* Understanding and applying different policy scopes (e.g., identity-based, resource-based).
* Adhering to best practices for cloud security and compliance in IAM.

## How This Portfolio Demonstrates My Skills

This repository provides tangible proof of my ability to:

* **Apply core IAM concepts** in real-world cloud environments.
* **Work hands-on with the management consoles and command-line interfaces** of major cloud providers.
