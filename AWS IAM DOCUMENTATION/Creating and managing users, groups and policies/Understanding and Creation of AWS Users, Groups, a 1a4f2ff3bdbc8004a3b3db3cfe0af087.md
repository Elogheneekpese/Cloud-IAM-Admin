# Understanding and Creation of AWS Users, Groups, and Policies: A Simple Guide.

If you've ever used AWS, you know it can feel like a giant maze of services, permissions, and security settings. One of the most important things to get right from the start is user managementâ€”who gets access to what and how you control it.

Letâ€™s break it down without the tech jargon and make it easy to understand.

## **First, Think of AWS Like a Big Office Building**

Imagine AWS as **a massive corporate building** with different departments, employees, and security access levels. Not everyone should have the keys to every room, right? Thatâ€™s where **Users, Groups, and Policies** come in.

---

## **Who Are AWS Users? Employees in the Office**

AWS **Users** are like company employees. Each one has a unique identity (username + password) and is given access to specific areas of the building (AWS services).

Example:

- A **developer** might need access to EC2 (virtual machines).
- A **finance team member** may only need access to billing reports.
- A **support engineer** might only access AWS logs to troubleshoot issues.

How **Do You Create an AWS User?**

1: Go to **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**.

2: Click **Users â†’ Add User**.

3: Done! The user can now log in with their credentials.

**Creating an I AM User that can log in through the web console**

**Step 1: Create a New IAM User**

1. In the **IAM Console**, click on **Users.**
2. Click the **"create users"** button.
3. Enter a **username** (e.g., Mercy)
4. Then review and create.
    - For this I AM user to have access to the AWS console, then go to security credentials and enable the console and custom-fill out the password
    - Then you can log in with your details to access the AWS console, but this time through I AM User

**What Are AWS Groups? Departments in the Office**

AWS **Groups** are like departments in the company. Instead of assigning permissions to each user one by one (which gets messy), you group users and give them shared access.

**Example:**

- **Developers Group** â†’ Access to EC2, S3, Lambda
- **Finance Group** â†’ Access to Billing
- **Support Team** â†’ Read-only access to logs

**How to Create a Group in AWS IAM?**

1: Go to **AWS IAM â†’ Groups â†’ Create Group**.

2: Add users who should be in this group.

3: Attach policies (explained next!).

4:Done! Everyone in the group gets the assigned permissions.

**What Are AWS Policies? (Security Access Badges in the Office)**

Policies are like **access badges** in our office analogy. They define **what a user or group is allowed to do** in AWS.

**Example Policies:**

- **AdministratorAccess:** Full control of everything ðŸš€
- **ReadOnlyAccess:** Can view everything but canâ€™t make changes ðŸ‘€
- **EC2FullAccess** â†’ Can create, modify, and delete EC2 instances

AWS Policies use JSON (a coding format), but donâ€™t worryâ€”you **donâ€™t need to write code** to apply them. You can use AWS-managed **policies** (pre-made templates) or create custom ones.

1: Go to **AWS IAM â†’ Policies, Create Policy** (or choose an existing one).

2: Select a **user or group** to apply it to.

3: Done! The permissions are now active.

AWS **Users, Groups, and Policies** are the foundation of **cloud security and access management**. By understanding how they work, you ensure **your AWS environment stays organized, secure, and efficient**.
